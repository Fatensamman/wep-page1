    <p>WHAT IS FOOD CULTURE?
        Food culture (by definition) refers to the practices, attitudes, and beliefs as well as the networks 
        and institutions surrounding the production, distribution, and consumption of food.
        
        That’s a mouth full so let’s break it down — food culture is the connection, beliefs, and experience 
        we have with food and our food system. It incorporates our cultural heritage and ethnicity, but is 
        not limited to it.  
        Our food culture is as much about our ethnic cultural heritage, as it is about our environmental 
        culture and the way our surrounding impact the foods we eat and the way we experience them.</p>

    <h2> Travel and Eat</h2>
    <p>
    
   Whether it's your goal to visit every country in the world or to simply sample the food each considers 
   its national dish, we have spent hours salivating over all the must-try dishes.

While some places have tried-and-true recipes that stem from limited options, others have foods influenced
 by a conflux of explorers, colonists and ex-pats. You may be surprised to learn how many of the most faraway 
 locales share the same tastes you do: Comfort food is a uniting commonality
